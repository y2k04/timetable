## Patch Notes

### v3.0.0
- Rewrote the entire program
- Added a more graphical first time setup
- Added cropping
- Added a menu bar _(which appears when the program is focused)_
- Added a minimise and exit button
- Replaced the Syncfusion.PDF library with _Docnet.Core_ 
- Moved the timetable and class list image location to the `AppData\Roaming` folder instead of using the application's folder
- Added last modified dates which are stored in the registry under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Timetable`
- Changed the icon for the program
- Changed the application font from _Microsoft Sans Serif_ to _Segoe UI_

#### Bug fixes
- Fixed the rapid relaunching to find the top-right corner of the screen (it was caused by a lazy exception fix I made ðŸ˜‚)
- Fixed the positioning of the Timetable window whenever the screen changes orientation (for example: rotating to portrait and then back to landscape would cause the window to move to the centre of the screen, instead of the corner)
- Fixed the application making the timetable and class list image read only when the program was open (it now stores it in memory)
